There is a publishing company that sells books and audio-records of these books. You must create a publication class that stores the title and price of the workbook. Two more classes are inherited from this class: book, in which the page counter changes, and the tape in which the minute counter changes. In each of these three classes there must be a getdata () method through which you can receive data from the user from the keyboard, and putdata (), which is used to output this data.
